# thingsss (for Webflow)
###### or for anything actually

_Collections of things, either from my webflow+actual dev scaffold or that I did for project requirements._

Made as JS classes to be used in larger codebases or through simple imports in Webflow projects. Usually also available on CodeSandbox to be forked and get straight into your project.
